        <answer>Tornados with "Telestar".- The Tornados (in the U.S. they were credited as The Tornadoes) were an English instrumental group of the 1960s, who acted as the in-house back-up group for many of Joe Meek's productions. The Tornados also enjoyed several chart hits in their own right, including the Number One "Telstar" (named after the satellite and composed by Meek). It was the first U.S. Number One by a British group. Up to that point, and since World War II, there had only been three British names that topped the U.S. chart: In May of 1962 "Stranger on the Shore" by clarinetist Mr. Acker Bilk; the second was "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" by Laurie London (1958), whilst the first was "Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart" by Vera Lynn (1952).</answer>

        <question>Who was Warner Brothers biggest German-born box office attraction in the 1920s?</question>
        <answer>Rin Tin Tin - Rin Tin Tin was the name given to several German Shepherd dogs in film and television. Nicknamed Rinty by his owner, the dog learned tricks and could leap 11 feet 9 inches. He was seen performing at a dog show by film producer Charles Jones, who paid Duncan to film Rinty. Duncan became convinced Rin Tin Tin could become the next Strongheart. The dog's big break came when he stepped in for a recalcitrant wolf in The Man From Hell's River (1922). Rin Tin Tin would be cast as a wolf or wolf-hybrid many times in his career, despite looking little to nothing like one. His first starring role, 1923's Where The North Begins, playing alongside silent screen actress Claire Adams, was a huge success often credited with saving Warner Brothers from bankruptcy.</answer>

        <question>Which stadium bears the name of the man who invented a method for machine guns to fire through revolving propellers in WW1 fighter planes?</question>
        <answer>Roland Garros - Roland Garros (October 6, 1888 – October 25, 1918) was an early French aviator and a fighter aircraft pilot during World War I. On April 18, 1915, he was shot down and glided to a landing on the German side of the lines. After examining Garros's plane, he and aircraft engineers designed an improved system known as the interrupter gear. Soon the tables were reversed against the Allies due to Fokker's planes shooting down nearly every enemy plane they met, leading to what became known as the Fokker Scourge. In the 1920s, a tennis centre was named after the pilot, Stade de Roland Garros. The stadium accommodates the French Open, one of tennis' Grand Slam tournaments. Consequently, the tournament is officially called Roland Garros.</answer>

        <question>True or false: A Frenchman has swam across the Atlantic</question>
        <answer>True - Far-fetched as it may seem, when Benoit Lecomte swam across the Atlantic in 1998 he introduced a new global sports challenge: the first person to swim around the world. On 16 July 1998 he set out from Cape Cod with 8 wet suits, a snorkel and some flippers into turning weather. Navigated through the 40th and 50th latitude by two French sailors on a 12m (40 foot) sailboat and protected by an electronic force field, Lecomte swam 6 to 8 hours a day at two-hour intervals. He mainly used the crawl stroke, switching occasionally to a mono fin and using an undulating dolphin kick to carry him over the 5 600km (3 736 nautical miles) of relentless waves. 72 days later, on 28 September, he swam ashore exhausted but heroic at Quiberon, France.</answer>

        <question>Which famous captain coined "el mar Pacifico"?</question>
        <answer>Magellan (English: Ferdinand Magellan - Portuguese: Fernão de Magalhães) - Magellan was a Portuguese-born maritime explorer who, at the service of Spain, attempted to find a westward route to the Spice Islands of Indonesia. This voyage became known as the first successful attempt at world circumnavigation. He did not complete his final, westward voyage; he was killed during the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines. As he died farther west than the Spice Islands, which he had visited on earlier voyages from the west, he became one of the first individuals to cross all the meridians of the globe. He was the first person to lead an expedition sailing westward from Europe to Asia and to cross the Pacific Ocean.</answer>

        <question>What was the name of  "the Sodum of the new world", the infamous pirate port in Jamaica that was destroyed by an earthquake in 1692?</question>
        <answer>Port Royal - Port Royal was the centre of shipping commerce in Jamaica in the 17th century. It was notorious for its gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals, and was a popular place for pirates to bring and spend their treasure. During the 17th century, the British actively encouraged and even paid buccaneers based at Port Royal to attack Spanish and French shipping. An earthquake, on June 7, 1692, largely destroyed Port Royal, causing two thirds of the city to sink into the Caribbean Sea such that today it is covered by a minimum of 25 ft (8 m) of water. Known today to 16th - 18th-century focused archaeologists as the City that sank, it is considered the most important underwater archaeological site in the western hemisphere, yielding 16th - 17th-century artifacts by the ton and many important treasures from indigenous peoples predating the 1588 founding from as far away as Guatemala.</answer>

        <question>What is a xenotransplant?</question>
        <answer>When one species cells (usually skin) are transplanted onto/into another species. Xenotransplantation (xeno- from the Greek meaning "foreign") is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another such as from pigs to humans. Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. The term allotransplantation refers to a same-species transplant. Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. A continuing concern is that cows and pigs have different lifespans than humans and their tissues age at a different rate. Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are a cause for concern.</answer>

        <question>Which nickname was given to the F-104 Starfighter?</question>
        <answer>The Widowmaker - The Starfighter was commonly called the "missile with a man in it," a name swiftly trademarked by Lockheed for marketing purposes. In service, American pilots called it the "Zipper" or "Zip-104" because of its prodigious speed. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force called it Eiko ("Glory"), but other export pilots were less charitable, many dubbing it "The Flying Coffin". The German public called it Witwenmacher ("Widowmaker"), fliegender Sarg ("Flying coffin") or Erdnagel ("Ground nail," the official military term for a tent peg). The Pakistani AF name was Badmash ("Hooligan"), while among Italian pilots its spiky design earned it the nickname Spillone ("Hatpin"), along with Bara volante ("Flying coffin"). Canadian pilots sometimes referred to it as the Flying lawn dart (a nickname also sometimes given to the aircraft's successor in the lightweight dogfighter role, the F-16 Fighting Falcon).</answer>

        <answer>Comet - The British de Havilland Comet first flew in 1949 and is noted as the world's first commercial jet airliner. Early models suffered from catastrophic metal fatigue and the aircraft was redesigned. The Comet 4 series subsequently enjoyed a long and productive career of over 30 years. The Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, the military derivative of the Comet airliner, is still in service. In 2007, the original decades-old airframes were being rebuilt with new wings and engines to produce the Nimrod MRA 4, expected to serve with Britain's Royal Air Force until the 2020s, more than 70 years after the Comet's first flight.</answer>

        <answer>Hercules - The Hughes H-4 Hercules ("Spruce Goose"), dubbed "The Edsel of Aviation", is an aircraft which was designed and built by Howard Hughes' Hughes Aircraft company. Its first and only flight took place in 1947. Hughes himself detested the nickname "Spruce Goose". The nickname arose as a way of mocking the Hercules project due to Hughes' alleged misuse of government funding to build the aircraft. The Hercules is the largest flying boat, and still holds the record for the largest wingspan of any aircraft in history. Only one was ever built.</answer>

        <answer>"Houston, we have a problem" - John Leonard 'Jack' Swigert, Jr., (August 30, 1931 – December 27, 1982) was a NASA astronaut. Swigert was one of three astronauts aboard the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission, which was launched on April 11, 1970. Originally part of the backup crew for the mission, he was assigned to the mission just days before launch, replacing astronaut Ken Mattingly. The prime crew had been exposed to German Measles (the Rubella virus) and, as Mattingly alone had no immunity to the disease, NASA did not want to chance him falling ill during any critical phases of the flight.</answer>

        <question>On which continents would you find the following animals: a: Bongo b: Guanaco c: Fuchskusu d: Oribi</question>
        <answer>Four Answers: a: Africa - The Western or Lowland Bongo, Tragelaphus eurycerus eurycerus, is a herbivorous, mostly nocturnal forest ungulate and among the largest of the African forest antelope species. Bongos are characterised by a striking reddish-brown coat, black and white markings, white-yellow stripes and long slightly spiralled horns. Indeed, bongos are the only Tragelaphid in which both sexes have horns. Bongos have a complex social interaction &amp; are found in African dense forest mosaics. b: South America - The guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is a camelid animal native to South America that stands approximately 1.06 m (3 ft 6 in) at the shoulder and weighs about 90 kg (200 lb). Like the llama, the guanaco is double coated with a coarse guard hair and soft undercoat, which is almost as fine as that of the alpaca, although they carry far less of it. The guanaco's soft wool is second only to that of the vicuña, a close relative. The colour varies very little, ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small straight ears. They are extremely striking with their large, alert brown eyes, streamlined form, and energetic pace. c: Australia - The Fuchskusu, or Common Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula, from the Greek for "furry tailed" and the Latin for "little fox") is the largest possum, and the Australian marsupial most often seen by city-dwellers, since it is one the very few that thrives in cities as well as a wide range of natural and human-modified environments. Despite its resemblance to a fox's brush, the characteristic tail is prehensile and is naked on its lower underside. d: Africa - Oribi are graceful slender-legged, long-necked small antelope found in grassland almost throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. They grow to around 92–110 cm (36 to 43 inches) in length, with a shoulder height of 50–66 cm (20 to 26 inches) and weigh an average of 12–22 kg (26 to 49 lb). They can run at speeds of up to 40–50 km/h (25–31 mph). In captivity they have a lifespan of up to 14 years.</answer>

        <question>Who was the lonely father of Uncas?</question>
        <answer>Chingachgook (in "The last of the Mohicans") - Chingachgook was a fictional character in four of James Fenimore Cooper's five Leatherstocking Tales, a lone Mohican chief and companion of the series' hero Natty Bumppo. Chingachgook married Wah-ta-Wah who bore him a son, Uncas, but she died young. Uncas grew to manhood but was killed in a battle with renegade Magua, leaving Chingachgook as The Last of the Mohicans. Chingachgook is said to have been modeled after a real-life wandering Mohican basket maker and hunter named Captain John. The fictional character, occasionally called John Mohegan in the series, was an idealized caricature of the traditional noble savage. The French often refer to Chingachgook as “Le Gros Serpent”, the Great Snake, because he understands the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly blow. Chingachgook, played by Gojko Mitic, was the main character of a popular East German Western, Chingachgook the Great Serpent (1967) based on Cooper's novels.</answer>

        <answer>Eyes and the Gluteus maximus - The gluteus maximus is the largest and most superficial of the three gluteal muscles. It makes up a large portion of the shape and appearance of the buttocks. It is a broad and thick fleshy mass of a quadrilateral shape, and forms the prominence of the nates. Its large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular system in humans, connected as it is with the power of maintaining the trunk in the erect posture. The muscle is remarkably coarse in structure, being made up of fasciculi lying parallel with one another and collected together into large bundles separated by fibrous septa.</answer>

It is sometimes referred to as Helsinki Syndrome; however, this may simply be due to the erroneous naming of the syndrome in popular media, for example, by an "expert psychologist" and author who appeared as a guest on a news program in the first Die Hard film.</answer>

        <question>What was the cause of death of Marie Curie?</question>
        <answer>Aplastic anemia strictly speaking, although radiation exposure could also be accepted - Her death near Sallanches in 1934 was from aplastic anemia, almost certainly due to exposure to radiation, as the damaging effects of hard radiation were not yet known, and much of her work had been carried out in a shed with no safety measures being taken. She carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket and stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the pretty blue-green light the substances gave off in the dark. Aplastic anemia is a condition where bone marrow does not produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells. The term 'aplastic' means the marrow suffers from an aplasia that renders it unable to function properly. Anemia is the condition of having fewer red blood cells than normal, or fewer than needed to function properly. Typically, anemia refers to low red blood cell counts, but aplastic anemia patients have lower counts of all three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.</answer>
